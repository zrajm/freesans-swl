FreeSans-SWL
============

This is an extented version of the Unicode font [GNU FreeSans], which includes
the symbols required for writing [Swedish Sign Language] transcriptions.

This font is suitable for both sign language transcription AND normal text, so
that you only need ONE font for an entire text. You can use it to write
English, Swedish, Arabic (etc) and transcriptions of Swedish Sign Language.

This implements the transcription system used by scholars of Swedish Sign
Language and the official [Swedish Sign Language Lexicon]. The system was
constructed by Brita Bergman in 1977 (inspired by [Stokoe notation] used for
[ASL]) but have been further refined and expanded since then (by Tomas Hedberg,
Lars Wallin, Thomas Bj√∂rkstrand and Nikolaus Riemer Kankkonen).

This typeface strives for completeness, and aim to include both current and
historical transcription symbols, as well as experimental symbols that have not
seen widespread use (yet).
